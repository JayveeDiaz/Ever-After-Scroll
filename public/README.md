# Public Assets

This is the folder where you should place your images, fonts, and other static files.

For example, if you add a photo named `my-wedding-photo.jpg` here, you can use it in your website's code with the path `/my-wedding-photo.jpg`.

Simply drag and drop your wedding photos into this directory.
